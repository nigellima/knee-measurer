# knee-measurer
Augmented Reality app (using Tango API) to measure and classify the knee's deviation angle on patients with knee-osteoarthritis.

Knee Osteoarthrosis (OA) is a degenerative disease that contributes greatly to reduced mobility and loss of functional independence. Usually, the short-size radiograph is used to estimate the angle of deviation that forms on the atanomic axis of the knee. In this work, we present the development of an augmented reality tool that assists in the measurement of this deviation, in a clinical way. We evaluated 27 knees from 15 patients, which the measurements were compared with the measurements obtained by the proposed method. The value obtained in the comparison of the measures shows a strongly significant agreement, with ICC = 0.972, validating the methodology as a measurement alternative.

The app was build using Unity 3D with Tango API. The smartphone used was the Lenovo Phab2 PRO, the first smartphone with built-in Tango technology
